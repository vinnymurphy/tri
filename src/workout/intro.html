  <hr>

  <h2><b><font size="-1">How Do I Get to the
  Workouts?</font></b></h2><font size="-1">The fast answer -- and one
  that you&#39;ll use most often -- is to simply click on the week that
  you&#39;re looking for in the left-hand column of the main
  &quot;Members Only&quot; page. The longer answer, to help you
  understand the structure of the program, is as follows:</font>

  <p><font><font size="-1">The SuperCoach training program is built in
  an organized hierarchy:</font></font></p>

  <ul>
    <li><font size="-1">The upcoming year has been broken into
    <b>seasons</b> (beginning with the Pre-Season, which generally goes
    from December through mid-May);</font></li>

    <li><font size="-1">Each season is broken into <b>training
    cycles</b>;</font></li>

    <li><font size="-1">Each training cycle is broken into
    <b>weeks</b>;</font></li>

    <li><font size="-1">Each week has a specific schedule for what to
    do <b>each day</b>.</font></li>
  </ul><font size="-1">To get to the training schedule for a particular
  week, simply click on the training schedule link for the
  desiredweek.</font>

  <p><b><font size="-1">So, What&#39;s Next?</font></b><br>
  <font size="-1">Go ahead and read the workouts online, &quot;click
  through&quot; to the terms/issues when you need further
  clarification, and print them out (choose the &quot;print&quot;
  option that&#39;s available with every browser) to help supplement
  your training log.</font></p>
