  "-1">Do I have to own a heart rate monitor?</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The specific training sessions in
  the SuperCoach program are defined in terms of time and intensity.
  The best way to measure time is with a watch; the best way to measure
  training intensity is with a heart rate monitor. The simple,
  straight-forward answer to this question is, therefore,
  &quot;yes&quot;.&#160;</font></font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="OtherSports" id="OtherSports"></a><b><font face=
  "Arial"><font size="-1">How do I incorporate other sports in my
  routine?</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">We get asked this question quite
  often, especially during winter ski season. Many of you enjoy
  downhill and cross-country skiing, snow-shoeing, etc. during the
  winter months, and want to know how this might effect your training
  schedule. Here&#39;s our standard advice: Whenever possible, you
  should put in your triathlon-related training in the early hours of
  the day, while you&#39;re somewhat rested. Then you can go crazy with
  whatever energy you have left! Also, on a more serious note, you
  should definitely go lighter on the heavy leg-related activity during
  those days when you should be recuperating (Monday and Friday,
  especially).&#160;</font></font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="Descending" id="Descending"></a><b><font face=
  "Arial"><font size="-1">What does &quot;descending&quot;
  mean?</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">In a set with a given number of
  repititions, you may be asked to &quot;descend&quot; the set from
  beginning to end. To descend the set means to get progressively
  faster with each repeat until you are going as fast as you can (or as
  fast as is required) on the final repeat of the set. Generally, the
  first repeat is done at a moderate speed so you don&#39;t begin too
  fast and run out of steam before the end of the set. Also, it is best
  to try to shave off the same amount of time from one repeat to the
  next, so that your progression throughout the set is both gradual and
  consistent.&#160;</font></font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="BuildUp" id="BuildUp"></a><b><font face=
  "Arial"><font size="-1">What does &quot;build up&quot;
  mean?</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Unlike <a href=
  "#Descending">descending</a>, which involves going progressively
  faster as a set progresses, &quot;build up&quot; means to go
  progressively faster during each individual repeat in a set. For
  example, 4 x 50 Build Up means to begin each 50 at a relatively easy
  pace, and gradually increase the effort such that you are going
  fairly hard (if not all out) by the end of each
  50.&#160;</font></font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="Intermediate" id="Intermediate"></a><b><font face=
  "Arial"><font size="-1">What does an &quot;Intermediate Set&quot; do
  for me?</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Think of an intermediate set as a
  stepping stone to help your body make a smooth transition from the
  warmup to the higher intensity work in the main set. This process
  aids in the opening of the blood vessels and arteries, as well as the
  flowing of highly oxygenated blood to the muscles. By increasing your
  heart rate during this set, the high intensity efforts of the main
  set won&#39;t seem like such a shock to the body. This preparation
  should allow you to perform the primary work more effectively. The
  chance of injury is also reduced because the body is notified that it
  needs to prepare for a hard effort and can therefore make the
  necessary physiological adaptations.&#160;</font></font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="Record" id="Record"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=
  "-1">Recording Your Progress</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">While simply training day-to-day
  will result in some improvement, how do you measure your success? By
  keeping track of your times and heart rates for a set of repeats on
  the bike trainer, at the track, or in the pool, you can very easily
  monitor your progress as the season progresses. Charting your
  progress will also help you psychologically because you will see that
  you have put in all the work necessary, and performed all the times
  needed in order to reach your Key Race goals.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Keep a daily diary of your
  workouts - you can just scribble your personal notes right along side
  your Super Coach training schedules. Compare identical workouts over
  time to see if your improvements are matching your expectations. If
  they do, then you know you are on track. If they don&#39;t, then you
  at least have the capacity to pore over your training notes to
  understand where future improvement can be made.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">An excellent way to track your
  progress is to use a computer-based training log. A simple, effective
  program that has been extremely successful for many years -- and was
  the first multi-sport program available, back in the late
  &#39;80&#39;s -- is <a href=

  <p><a name="Eating" id="Eating"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=
  "-1">Proper Eating Guidelines</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Question:</font></font><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">&quot;One question I have is to do
  with the excess weight I&#39;m carrying. Its starting to disappear
  slowly and I&#39;m guessing the rate of weight-loss may increase as
  the training durations increase...Should I be dieting alongside the
  training or could this lead to extra fatigue?</font></font><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Do you have an opinion on
  decreasing carbos in favour of protein and fat (like the PR*Bar diet
  thing?)&quot;</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Our Answer: Be careful on the
  dieting -- you want to eat properly, whichmeans a balance of carbos,
  proteins, and good quality fats (extra virgin olive oil, 100% natural
  peanut butter, broiled fish). Of course, you&#39;ll definitely watch
  the pounds (kg?) peel off in the early Spring, and you&#39;ll
  continue to trim down over the course of the summer months. But
  balancing the carbos/protein/fat to roughly 40%/30%/30% (without
  being ridiculously meticulous about it) will enable you to burn fat,
  rather than muscle, as the durations increase.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Let me explain the balance in
  very brief terms: We all require a certain amount of protein to
  produce/replenish muscle fibres, etc; there is a desirable amount of
  carbohydrates to replenish glycogen stores (too many carbos, however,
  will knock your insulin levels out of whack &amp; you&#39;ll be
  ravenously hungry all evening); the high quality fat acts like
  &quot;caloric ballast&quot; to actually help you feel comfortably
  full after eating.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">I&#39;ve experienced both sides
  -- eating like a horse, and trying to balance my intake -- and the
  balanced approach has left me with more muscle mass at the same
  overall body weight. Clearly &quot;less is more&quot; when you eat
  properly.&#160;</font></font></p>

  <p><a name="IncInt" id="IncInt"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=
  "-1">Increasing Intensities</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Question: &quot;During the
  workouts (ususally swim &amp; bike) I notice it takes a while to
  increase HR intensity up to 75% or 84%. How long should this
  take?&quot;</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Our Answer: It will take longer
  at first, but as your body gets better adapted to this training your
  HR will be quicker to react to the increased work load. Believe it or
  not, higher HR&#39;s are a sign of <i>better</i> conditioning, since
  your body is responding to an increased need for oxygen by beating
  your heart (a muscle) faster, with more blood volume per beat. So, do
  the best you can with it now; your body will get better at it very
  shortly.&#160;</font></font></p>

  <p><a name="Intervals" id="Intervals"></a><b><font face=
  "Arial"><font size="-1">Interval Workout
  Instructions</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">We have begun to describe interval
  sessions in terms of <b>distance</b> (both English and metric units)
  as well as <b>time</b>. This is due to the fact that many of you are
  using different wind trainer models, and some of you are riding
  outside.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The way to interpret these
  session instructions is to use the distance figures first, provided
  that you finish within 30 seconds (more or less) of the suggested
  interval time. If you find that covering the interval distance takes
  significantly less than the suggested time, keep riding/running until
  the time guideline is met; if covering the distance would take more
  time, then simply stop at the suggested time, going into the recovery
  phase before starting the next interval.&#160;</font></font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="AerobicInt" id="AerobicInt"></a><b><font face=
  "Arial"><font size="-1">Aerobic Interval
  Guidelines</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Question: &quot;I wanted to ask
  you something about intervals. For example, in any of the three
  sports, say that we&#39;re supposed to do 1:30 @75%, then :30 @60%.
  Most often it takes longer than 30 seconds to get my HR down to 60%.
  Is it ok if my HR never makes it that low before I start up again on
  the next interval? If I wait for my HR to get down to 60%, the rest
  in between intervals will get to be ridiculously long! So, should the
  &quot;rest&quot; be just a time thing, or should I really wait to get
  the HR down to that level?&quot;</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Our Answer: Good question!
  First, make sure that the 75% target isn&#39;t set too high -- make
  sure that your Max HR is realistic (220 - age, plus about 5 beats for
  running / minus about 5 beats for cycling), and make sure that your
  resting HR is accurate. We don&#39;t want you to be getting closer to
  80% when 75% is what&#39;s called for.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Second, when doing aerobic
  intervals it&#39;s not vital to have your HR dip all the way back
  down to 60% -- just don&#39;t let it get below that! The idea is to
  have the entire set be good quality aerobic work. That said, make
  sure that you&#39;re backing it down enough to reduce your HR by at
  least 10% within the required recovery time. Take a little more
  recovery time if necessary, but not more than an extra 15-30
  seconds.&#160;</font></font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="TargetHRs" id="TargetHRs"></a><b><font face=
  "Arial"><font size="-1">Target Heart Rates When
  Racing</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The optimal zone in which to race
  is dependent on the distance of the race. The majority of an
  international distance race should be done at or just below your AT
  (88-92%), with the final miles of the run being done slightly above
  AT.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">For half-Ironman races, your HR
  should be between 75% and 85%, but mostly at around 10% (in terms of
  beats per minute) below AT. The hotter and hillier the course (hello,
  Wildflower!), the more reserved you need to be during the swim and
  bike legs so that you have enough energy left for the
  run.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Finally, the majority of an
  Ironman-distance race needs to be done at or below 75% for you to
  remain efficient and finish strong. By elevating your HR into your
  anaerobic zones too much -- or to &quot;shock&quot; your system there
  at all -- you run the risk of building up much lactic acid to levels
  that will trigger an elevated heart rate for a prolonged period. In
  general, it&#39;s much better to think you have too much energy left
  at the end of the bike. Finishing with a strong run is what will keep
  you coming back for more!</font></font></p>

  on time?</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">It&#39;s perfectly fine to cut off
  the swim workouts once you&#39;ve reached the designated time -- the
  best way to &quot;trim&quot; these sessions would be to cut back the
  main set, keeping the warm up, cool down, and drills intact (these
  are too important to reduce too much).</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">In the future, look for two
  different &quot;flavors&quot; of the main set (labeled,
  &quot;ALTERNATE SET&quot;) to help you make this minor

  <p><a name="Choice" id="Choice"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=
  "-1">Choice (&quot;Non-Free&quot;): Practicing Different
  Strokes</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">When a particular swimming set is
  supposed to be done as &quot;Choice&quot;, this means that a stroke
  other than freestyle is preferred. By practicing all four strokes --
  freestyle, butterfly, breaststroke and backstroke -- you are
  essentially cross-training in the pool. You will use muscles in ways
  that you can&#39;t when you only swim freestyle, so you will be
  improving your overall muscular balance and shape.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The&#160;<a name="IM" id=
  "IM"></a><b>&quot;IM&quot; (Individual Medley)</b> is an actual
  swimming event that combines butterfly, backstroke, breastroke, and
  freestyle (in that order). When this is called for in a swim workout,
  divide the IM distance evenly between these four strokes, in the
  proper order.&#160;</font></font></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="Kick" id="Kick"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=
  "-1">Swimming Kick Drills</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Swimming Kick drills involve
  isolating the part of the stroke involving the legs to improve
  efficiency and body position in the water. These drills can be done
  several ways: you can hold a kick board out in front of you, keeping
  your arms straight; you can lie flat in a freestyle position, without
  a board, holding your hands together out in front of you; or - our
  preferred method - you can lie on one side with your
  &quot;bottom&quot; arm out in front and your &quot;top&quot; arm down
  at your side, holding this position for 12 kick &quot;beats&quot;.
  Then - without stopping - rotate through one arm stroke, leaving
  yourself lying on the other side with your arm positions reversed.
  Kick 12 beats on that side, and then repeat this process up and down
  the pool.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Unless specified otherwise,
  practice your freestyle kick, as this will make your swimming in
  races more proficient -- a strong kick helps keep your body more
  buoyant and, thus, allows you to spend more of your energy moving
  forward instead of keeping your body on the surface of the
  water.&#160;</font></font></p>

  <p><a name="Loco" id="Loco"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=
  "-1">&quot;Loco&quot; Swims</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">A &quot;loco&quot; swim (short for
  &quot;locomotive&quot;), is a progression of alternating easy laps
  with fast laps to produce a fartlek effect. In a 1000 loco swim, you
  will begin with 25 easy/25 fast, then continue with 50 easy/50 fast,
  75 easy/75 fast, 100 easy/100 fast, 100 easy/100 fast, 75 easy/75
  fast, 50 easy/50 fast, and finally 25 easy/25 fast.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The fast laps should be done at
  a controlled, high intensity, while the easy laps are used for
  recovery. It&#39;s important to continue swimming, without stopping,
  throughout these swims.&#160;</font></font></p>

  <p><a name="Pull" id="Pull"></a><b><font face="Arial"><font size=

  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Pull buoys are those white
  styrofoam aids that are pressed between the thighs when we want to
  isolate the arm strokes in the pool. <a href="#Paddles">Paddles</a>
  can be used in conjunction with pull buoys to help heighten
  sensitivity to technical errors you may be making in your stroke and
  to overload the upper body to increase the cardiovascular/muscular

  "Arial"><font size="-1">Counting Strokes Per
  Length</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Your stroke count (# of strokes
  taken per length) is an important indicator of swimming efficiency:
  the better swimmers take fewer strokes per length. The most efficient
  swimmers are able to maintain a consistent, low stroke count even
  when swimming at very high intensities. As a point of reference,
  world class distance swimmers will take between 10-15 strokes a lap
  during their freestyle races, and between 8-12 during moderately hard
  workout swims.&#160;</font></font></p>

  <p><a name="Paddles" id="Paddles"></a><b><font face=

  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Using paddles is a great way to
  overload the upper body to gain swim-specific upper body strength.
  Also, paddle use will magnify whatever weaknesses you have in your
  stroke or muscle endurance.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">However, guard against becoming
  dependent on paddles. Many swimmers swim faster when using paddles --
  and therefore end up using them most of the time! Using paddles too
  much can lead to shoulder injuries and will almost certainly cause
  your swimming skills &amp; general speed without paddles to
  deteriorate over time. We therefore instruct you to utilize them
  sparingly -- they can be very effective tools for improvement if
  they&#39;re not overused.</font></font></p>

  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">An easy drill to ensure that you
  incorporate a long, effective warmup into your workout is to use what
  we call a &quot;gearing pyramid&quot;. The general idea is to
  continue spinning at roughly 90-95 rpm while increasing the gearing
  throughout the set.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Begin in a very easy gear for a
  specified period of time (either 4, 5, or 6:00); after this you would
  shift to one gear harder and spin for 1:00 less (3, 4, or 5:00). You
  would continue to shift gears after each interval and reduce the
  duration of the next interval, until you have completed spinning in
  the hardest gear of the set for 1:00. Then, you&#39;re ready to
  go!&#160;</font></font></p>

  "-1">Isolated Leg Training</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Isolated Leg Training (usually
  abbreviated to &quot;ILT&quot;) is done while biking on a stationary
  trainer. While using a relatively small gear (in your small front
  chain ring, such as 42 x 19) click out one foot from your pedal and
  rest it on the axle of your turbo trainer or a chair you have set up
  next to your bike. With one leg still engaged in the pedal, work on a
  smooth, circular pedal revolution. Try to be sensitive to - and try
  to correct -- jerky or dead spots in your cadence. After pedaling
  with one leg for the required amount of time (usually 20 seconds),
  you can then spend about 10 seconds in transition - switching from
  one isolated leg to the other. The drill continues with the newly
  &quot;isolated&quot; leg providing the power for the required amount
  of time; continue to switch as the drill requires.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Anything that detracts from a
  smooth pedal stroke will also detract from your overall speed and
  will waste energy. As your cadence becomes smoother, you should
  notice it taking less energy to go at a given speed. This will leave
  more energy to bike faster and leave more energy for your
  run!</font></font></p>

  should be done in stand-alone mode -- unplugging the cord from the
  side of the handlebar unit.&#160; Make sure you follow the
  instructions for calibrating the unit properly before you
  begin.&#160; Then set the constant resistance to a challenging number
  -- but not too tough -- to keep the resistance constant throughout
  each pedal stroke.&#160; This will help you work out any &quot;dead
  spots&quot; in each leg individually.</font></font><br></p>

  Up</font></font></b><br>
  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Varying your gearing when riding
  indoors on your trainer is an excellent mechanism for breaking up the
  monotony and recruiting different types of muscle fibres, keeping
  some &quot;freshness&quot; in the process. The idea is to choose
  three gears, which are one &quot;click&quot; apart: one gearing
  should be relatively easy, where you can spin close to 100 rpm
  withoutmuch challenge; you should be able to spin in the next hardest
  gearing at about 90 rpm; and you should be able to push the hardest
  gearing at 80 rpm without much difficulty. An example of a
  &quot;VG&quot; set of gears is 42 (small chain ring) x 13, 42 x 15,
  and 42 x 17.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">During the &quot;VG&quot; Set,
  you will actually be called upon to spin a bit faster than these rpm
  figures. The set for that session should specify what these
  guidelines are - usually they are 110+ rpm for the easy gear, 100 rpm
  for the medium gear, and 90 rpm for the hardest gear. The order will
  always be: #1 medium, #2 easy, and #3 hard. See the actual session
  instructions for further details.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">My biggest concern is that
  spinning classes are usually directed by someone who doesn&#39;t have
  a clue about triathlon training, and they generally want to insert a
  significant amount of anaerobic work throughout their session. For
  these reasons I would advise against participating in a spinning
  class unless:</font></font></p>

  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Lots of analysis and discussion
  has taken place through the years in the cycling arena regarding the
  optimal cadence for time trialing. The most meaningful data we&#39;ve
  seen involved determining what cadence the top time trialists used
  and the related power output. The ultimate conclusions tend to agree
  that the optimal time trialing cadence is around 85
  rpms.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">However, most people like to
  spin at between 90-100 rpms, and some pro cyclists (Indurain, in
  particular) go even higher to 110-120 rpms during 40K all out
  efforts. Spinning at 90-95 rpms will leave your legs -- and
  especially your knees -- feeling less stressed than they would at a

  shorter distance (usually 100 or 200 meters), alternating high
  intensity (the &quot;in&quot; section) and low intensity (the
  &quot;out&quot; section), for a total of 5-10 minutes. If you are
  performing this set on the road rather than the track, then you can
  substitute 30 seconds for the &quot;in&quot; sections and 45 sections
  for the &quot;out&quot; sections - performing about 4-8 &quot;in and

  Performing these short 10-15 second &quot;bursts&quot; will help to
  open up your blood vessels for better blood flow, and they naturally
  stretch out most muscles in the body to help prevent strains and
  injuries.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">On a track, you will gradually
  increase your speed on the straighaways to about 5k pace for the
  first 60 meters and then hold your speed for the final 40 meters. You
  then ease up and jog the curves before building up your speed on the
  next straightaway. You should do at least 3 and no more than 6
  run-ups. After finishing this, take a couple of minutes to shake out

  <font face="Arial"><font size="-1">A tempo run is a valuable tool in
  teaching your body to run more efficiently at or near your race pace
  for a prolonged period of time. The effort can last up to 30 minutes,
  or be broken into two or three 8-10 minute segments with up to 2
  minutes rest between tempo efforts.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">The effort will be hard, but
  below your 10k race pace -- usually at around 85% intensity. At this
  speed, you will deal with discomfort yet feel like you can push
  harder. Don&#39;t! When done at too great an effort, tempo runs can
  break your body down too much and lead to overtraining and/or injury.
  Tempo runs enhance your ability to race at or near your AT, which is
  crucial in any event lasting from 30 minutes up to 2+ hours. The
  principles behind tempo runs will also be applied to swimming or
  biking.&#160;</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">(4:00 @70% / 1:00 @60%); (3:00

    <b><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">Leg turnover should be done

  -- All world class distance runners have a cadence that falls within
  this range.</font></font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial"><font size="-1">When you go out for a run at HR
  70% intensity or higher, it is important to work on keeping your

  &quot;Great!&quot; Hey, I don&#39;t care if you have to lie down in

  to process energy in an aerobic state (with oxygen, as opposed to the
  anaerobic metabolism required for high intensity efforts), and this
  kind of low intensity training is the only efficient way to get this
  done. But don&#39;t fret too much -- year after year, the athetes are
  surprised and amazed at how quickly their bodies adapt to this new
  approach. So be confident that it&#39;s going to happen, your aerobic
  capacity will increase, and yes, you will be able to run at a nice

  perform this at a local track (preferably one you can run to), or use
  a familiar portion of a local course that you know to be roughly
  three miles in length. Begin by gradually increasing your HR up to
  75% intensity -- beginning this directly after the warm up would work
  best -- and then, when you are at a known starting point, start your
  watch! Be sure to hold your HR intensity right at 75% throughout the
