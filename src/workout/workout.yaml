      that you perform the higher intensity bike effort first.

      season, these sessions can be shorter because they will also be more efficient
      -- no stopping for stop lights, very controllable terrain, etc. We will also
      begin to incorporate a short run after this ride once the weekly training durations
      get a bit longer.

      the ride outdoors if this option is available. In addition, there will be times
      when the main set will guide you to a more efficient, more effective workout.
      Use your judgment to ensure that you're getting the desired workout without
      unnecessary risk of injury or burnout.
